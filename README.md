# PROCEDURE:

### 1.Prepare your workspace:
     Choose a clean, well-lit, and static-free area to work in.
     Place the motherboard on a non-conductive.  
     surface like its anti-static bag.
### 2.Install the CPU (Central Processing Unit):
     * Open the CPU socket on the motherboard.
     * Align the CPU with the socket, ensuring the notches match.
     * Gently place the CPU into the socket without applying any force.
     * Close the socket lever to secure the CPU.

### 3. Install the CPU Cooler:
    * Apply thermal paste to the CPU  (if not pre-applied on the cooler).
    * Attach the CPU cooler according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    * Connect the cooler's fan to the CPU fan header on the motherboard

### 4.Install RAM (Random Access Memory):
    * Open the RAM slots on the motherboard.
    * Align the notch on the RAM stick with the slot on the motherboard.
    * Press down evenly on both ends of the RAM stick until it clicks into place

### 5.Install the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):
     * If your CPU has integrated graphics, this step may be unnecessary.
     * Align the GPU with the PCIe slot on the motherboard.
     * Push down gently until it clicks into place.
     * Secure the GPU with screws to the case (if required).

### 6.Install Storage Drives:
     * Mount SSDs or HDDs in drive bays or brackets inside the case.
     * Connect the SATA or NVMe data cables to the motherboard.
     * Connect the power cables to the drives and power supply.
